# Blowfish Enhanced Randomized Audio Steganography

## This is a project done as a part of the course Cryptography - Theory and Practice 

This script takes in text data as input, encrypts it using blowfish algorithm, and encodes it into an audio file. For more details on the algorithm, refer to the PDF in the repo. The bit depth of the encoding algorithm can be modified in the `main.py` file to experiment how audio gets distorted for any various bit depths. 

### Steps to set up the requirements to run the code:


- Go to the projects folder in your terminal.
- Run `pip install -r 'requirements.txt'` to install the modules required for running the python scripts.

### To run the encryption and decryption script

- Run `python main.py` 

### To run the analysis script

- Run `python analysis.py`
